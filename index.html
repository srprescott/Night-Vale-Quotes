            <quote>When work feels overwhelming, remember that you’re going to die.</quote>
            
            <quote>Death is only the end if you assume the story is about you.</quote>
            <quote>There is a thin semantic line separating weird and beautiful, and that line is covered in jellyfish.</quote>
            <quote>Guns don’t kill people. It’s impossible to be killed by a gun. We are all invincible to bullets and it’s a miracle. </quote>
            <quote> Mostly we don’t get destroyed… Mostly we destroy ourselves.</quote>
            <quote>The past tense of regret is indecision.</quote>
            <quote>When life seems dangerous and unmanageable, just remember that it is, and that you can’t survive forever.</quote>
            <quote>Are we safe from harm? Of course not, we never are. But that’s not the right question. The question is are we living a life that is worth the harm?</quote>
            <quote>We are not history yet. We are happening now. How miraculous is that?</quote>
            <quote>Whisper a dangerous secret to someone you care about. Now they have the power to destroy you, but they won't. This is what love is.</quote>
            
            <quote> The living tell the dying not to leave, and the dying do not listen. The dying tell us not to be sad for them, and we do not listen. The dialogue between the living and the dead is full of misunderstanding and silence. </quote>
            <quote>A friendly desert community where the sun is hot, the moon is beautiful and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep. Welcome to Night Vale.</quote>
            <quote>The past is gone, and cannot hurt you anymore. And while the future is fast coming for you, it always flinches first, and settles in as the gentle present. This now, this us, we can cope with that.</quote>
            <quote>The universe is vast. You are also vast. So is an ant. There are different sizes of infinity.</quote>
            <quote>We did not crumble, we did not back down. We stood eye to eye with violence and it blinked first.</quote>
            <quote>90% of your body is water. 6% is delusion. 4% is lies.</quote>
            <quote>Angels aren’t real! I might have howled this while covering my eyes.</quote>
            
            <quote>Don’t let numbers tell you what to do. You are blood and earth, not theory and chalk.</quote>
            <quote>Here is the truth of nostalgia: we don’t feel it for who we were, but who we weren’t. We feel it for all the possibilities that were open to us, but that we didn’t take.</quote>
            <quote>We will always be in that most dangerous, most exciting, most possible time of all The Now. Where we can never know what shape the next moment will take. </quote>
            <quote>There’s a monster under your bed. A monster at your window. A monster any place you imagine one. You project your monsters on the world. </quote>
            <quote>If you love someone, set them free. Set them free now! This is the police. We have you surrounded. </quote>
            <quote>There’s a monster at the end of this book. It’s the blank page where the story ends and you’re left alone with yourself and your thoughts.</quote>
            <quote>We must continue to fight and resist. We must be the heroes we look for in others. We must no longer speak in code, but in action.</quote>
            <quote>We understand so much. But the sky behind those lights– mostly void, partially stars– that sky reminds us we don’t understand even more.</quote>
            <quote>He has a square jaw and teeth like a military cemetery. He grinned, and everything about his was perfect, and I fell in love instantly.</quote>
            <quote>We are not one person. How lonely would that be? A couple who has made themselves one so completely that they are once again alone. We are two people. Separate. Unique. And joined only where we choose to join.</quote>
            <quote>Lie down and look up at the ceiling and breathe with those curiously fragile lungs of yours and remind yourself: Don’t worry. All is as it was meant to be. It was meant to be lonely, and terrifying, and unfair, and fleeting. Don’t worry.</quote>
            <quote>There’s nothing under your bed. There’s nothing in your closet. Nothing waits in every darkness. Nothing in the most terrifying thing of all.</quote>
            <quote>The last thing I want to do is hurt you. And after that, the to-do list is complete and I can go home and watch TV.</quote>
            <quote>All the beauty I the world was made within the oppressive limitations of time, and death, and impermanence. </quote>
            <quote>Schools will be closed all next week because nothing really matters and is anything even real?</quote>
            <quote>Be proud of your place in the cosmos. It is small and yet it is. </quote>
            <quote>A friendly desert community where the sun is hot, the moon is beautiful and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep. Welcome to Night Vale.</quote>
            <quote>Have you ever thought about the moon? I was sitting outside last night looking at it and I thought, Does anyone actually know what that thing is? Have there been studies on this?</quote>
           <quote>We have survived all the way from birth to this very moment and we look at each other and some of us start laughing and others start weeping and one or two of us break out into workless humming song and all of us mean the exact same thing. Look at us. Look at us out in the honey light of the finished day. Look at us and rejoice in our sheer being.</quote>
            <quote>We understand the lights.</quote>
            <quote>The man is holding something. He is holding a cat.</quote>
            <quote>I fear for anyone caught between what they know and what they don’t yet know that they don’t know.</quote>
            <quote>Confused? At a loss for what to do? Wow, sounds like you’re human. Good luck!</quote>
            <quote>Nobody does a slice like big Rico's. Nobody.</quote>
            <quote>Everything is some level of probably. Nothing is a promise. </quote>
            <quote>We will worship a smiling god no longer.</quote>
            <quote>Driving Safety Tips: Do not turn on your high-beams in fog. You do not want to see what is actually in this fog.</quote>
            <quote>I have chosen not to be certain of anything at all.</quote>
            <quote>I like my coffee like I like my nights: dark, endless, and impossible to sleep through. </quote>
            <quote>Be careful what you wish for, because it probably won't come true and like is mostly about expectation management.</quote>
            <quote>If at first you don't succeed, look around and find out who is trying to sabotage you with telepathic interference. It is someone you know.</quote>
            <quote>Remember that at your smallest components, you are indistinguishable from a forest fire.</quote>

            <quote>Looking for a simply solution to all life's problems? We are proud to present obstinate denial. Accept no substitute. Accept nothing.</quote>
            <quote>Please only donate your blood to organizations that are asking for blood. This has been problematic for many unprepared charities.</quote>
            <quote>Believe in yourself. You are an ancient, absent god, discussed only rarely by literary scholars. So if you don't believe, no one will.</quote>
            <quote>Just because when you looked in the crystal ball you saw nothing, doesn't mean it wasn't correctly showing you your future.</quote>
            <quote>Believe in yourself. You'll exist either way but, eh, why not?</quote>
            <quote>May you find love. May you find it wherever it's been hidden. May you find why has been hiding it and exact revenge upon them.</quote>
